Hi
The goal of this project to sharpen my HTML and Bash skills through repition of basic commands. 
I'm expecting to make multiple nested web pages as well as you HTML text modifiers. 
I'll also likely be inputting images and bullets and such, so touching on all the basics. 

Outside of that, file management in bash and getting comfortable with git. 
Righto
